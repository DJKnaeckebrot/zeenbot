# zeenbot

zeenbot is a feature rich multi purpose discord bot writen in JavaScript.

It inititaly was planed to be a private project but as I recently stopped working on it actively, I decided to make it open source.

# Update

I might nor not will update the bot at a later time. The bot has some performance issues which I not yet fixed.

# Config

The bot uses Assistants Centers Discord Dashboard and Soft UI in a modified version. To use it copy the .env.example and fill in your details. Also modify the /Events/Client/config.json according to [Soft UI settings](https://dbd-docs.assistantscenter.com/soft-ui/setup/#creating-config-json)
